# Recorded Course Script Generator

Generate video course scripts with MECE-structured curriculum, engaging content, and production guidance. Optimized for 2-5 minute micro-lessons with case studies and analogies.

## Process

### 1. Define Course Parameters
- **Course:** Title, topic, target audience, prerequisites, duration, format
- **Objectives:** 3-5 measurable outcomes (action verb + skill + context)
- **Structure:** Modules, lessons per module, lesson duration (5-15 min recommended)

### 2. MECE Curriculum Structure
Organize into Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive modules:
- Foundation → Core Skills → Application
- Each module builds on previous ones

### 3. Lesson Structure (5-15 minutes)
- **Opening (5-10%)**: Hook, outcome, roadmap
- **Main Content (70-75%)**: Concepts with explanations + examples
- **Closing (10-15%)**: Summary, practice, transition

### 4. Lesson Script Template (4C Structure)

```markdown
## [Lesson Title] ([Time])

**Outcome:** [Specific skill learners will gain]

---

### 1. Connect/Hook (10-15s)
*[Visual: On camera or text overlay]*
"Welcome back! Today we're diving into [topic]."
OR "Did you know that [stat]?" OR "Have you ever [question]?"

### 2. Concept ([Time])
*[Visual: Slides, graphics, or demo]*
"Let me explain [concept]..."
- Use analogies: "Think of it like..."
- Use case studies: "For example, at [company]..."
- Use concrete examples

### 3. Collaborate/Practice ([Time])
*[Visual: Question on screen]*
"Now, take a moment to think: [reflection question]..."
*[Pause]*
"Here's the answer: [concise response]"

### 4. Consolidate/Close (30-60s)
*[Visual: On camera, summary slide]*
"To recap: [key point 1], [key point 2], [key point 3]."
"Your action step: [specific practice]."
"Next time, we'll [preview]. See you then!"
```

### 5. Production Guidelines

**Visual:**
- Slides: Minimal text, clear graphics, consistent branding
- Camera: Eye-level, direct address, professional setting
- Overlays: Key points, definitions, examples

**Audio:**
- Voice: Clear, energetic, conversational
- Pace: Moderate with pauses for emphasis
- Music: Optional, subtle background

**Delivery:**
- Eye contact with camera
- Natural gestures
- Enthusiastic tone

## Lesson Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Lecture | Direct instruction, concepts, examples |
| Demo | Step-by-step walkthrough, screen recording |
| Interview | Guest Q&A, multiple perspectives |
| Case Study | Real-world problem-solution examples |
| Hybrid | Mix of above for engagement |

## Best Practices Checklist

**Structure:** Hook, clear outcome, logical flow, examples, actionable practice

**Content:** Conversational tone, concrete over abstract, stories/examples, visual interest

**Production:** Good lighting/audio, professional appearance, consistent slides, text overlays

**Engagement:** Enthusiasm, eye contact, natural gestures, learner connection

# Workshop Outline Generator

Generate learner-centered workshop and training outlines using MECE structure, Training from Back of Room (TfBR), and VAK learning styles.

## Purpose

Design effective workshop outlines that:
- Apply MECE structure (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)
- Use TfBR 4C design (Connection, Concepts, Concrete Practice, Conclusion)
- Include VAK elements (Visual-Auditory-Kinesthetic)
- Balance 70% activities / 30% content delivery
- Define measurable, action-based learning outcomes

## When to Use

Trigger when users ask for:
- Workshop or training outlines
- Course structures or agendas
- Training session designs
- 培训大纲 / 工作坊设计 / 课程结构

## Design Process

### 1. Gather Requirements

Clarify before generating:
- **Topic:** What is the training subject?
- **Audience:** Who are the learners? (level, background, pain points)
- **Duration:** Half-day, full-day, multi-day (default: 2 days)
- **Format:** In-person, virtual, hybrid
- **Outcomes:** What should learners be able to DO after training?
- **Practical Level:** Should learners bring real cases for practice?
- **Reference Material:** Existing course outline (if any)

### 2. Apply MECE Structure

Organize into non-overlapping, comprehensive modules:

```
[Topic] Workshop (MECE)
├── Module 1: [Category A]
│   ├── Topic 1.1
│   └── Topic 1.2
├── Module 2: [Category B]
│   ├── Topic 2.1
│   └── Topic 2.2
└── Module 3: [Category C]
    ├── Topic 3.1
    └── Topic 3.2
```

### 3. Define Learning Outcomes

Use performance-based outcomes with action verbs (NOT "understand"):

```
After this module, participants will be able to [action verb] [specific skill]
in [context] to [result].
```

**Action Verbs:** Apply, demonstrate, practice, create, design, analyze, evaluate, deliver

**Example:** "After this module, participants will be able to deliver constructive feedback to direct reports using the SBI model to improve performance without defensiveness."

### 4. Design Using TfBR 4Cs

| 4C Phase | Time | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Connection** | 5-10% | Welcome, outcomes, agenda, icebreaker |
| **Concepts** | 20-30% | Just-in-time, just-enough content |
| **Concrete Practice** | 50-70% | Skill drills, role-plays, applications |
| **Conclusion** | 5-10% | Commitments, action planning, resources |

**Activity Types:**
- Assessment: Self-evaluations, diagnostics
- Experience: Simulations, role-plays, games
- Practice: Skill drills, rehearsals
- Reflection: Journaling, pair sharing, ORID debriefs
- Application: Real projects, action planning

### 5. Integrate VAK Elements

| Component | Visual | Auditory | Kinesthetic |
|-----------|--------|----------|-------------|
| Content | Diagrams, models, slides | Stories, explanations | Demonstrations |
| Activities | Charts, worksheets | Discussions, debriefs | Role-plays, movement |
| Materials | Handouts, visuals | Audio | Manipulatives, tools |

### 6. When Reference Outline is Provided

First, provide an optimization table with:
- Assessment of original modules (strengths/weaknesses)
- Restructured module flow and sequence
- New SMART learning objectives per module
- Targeted additions/deletions
- Improved teaching methods and interactive elements
- Revised time allocations

Then generate the detailed outline.

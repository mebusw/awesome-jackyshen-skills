# Opening Remarks Generator

Create compelling training openings that build rapport, establish psychological safety, set clear expectations, and generate engagement.

## When to Use

Use this skill when users need:
- Training/workshop opening remarks

- Introductional speaking

## Opening Types

| Type | Structure | Best For |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Connection** | Welcome → Human moment → Bridge → Transition | Building rapport first |
| **Story** | Hook → Climax → Insight → Bridge | Emotional engagement |
| **Question** | Provocative question → Reflection → Share → Connect | Challenging assumptions |
| **Statistic** | Shocking stat → Meaning → Relevance → Bridge | Data-driven topics |
| **Activity** | Instructions → Run (3-5 min) → Debrief → Connect | High-energy sessions |
| **Vision** | Future state → Current reality → Training path → Call | Inspirational topics |

## ORID Framework

- **O - Objective**: "Today we'll explore [topic]. You'll walk away with [outcomes]. Here's our agenda..."
- **R - Reflective**: "How are you feeling about [topic]? Turn to your neighbor: one word describing your expectations."
- **I - Interpretive**: "Why this matters? Because [implication]. What's at stake is [consequence]."
- **D - Decisional**: "My ask: [engagement commitment]. In return, I promise to [your commitment]."

## Essential Elements

**Welcome** (Always)
> "Good morning! Welcome to [training name]."

**Outcomes** (Clear statement)
> "By the end of today, you'll be able to [action verb] [skill], [action verb] [skill], and [action verb] [skill]."

**Agenda** (Brief)
> "Roadmap: [Time] - [Module 1], [Time] - [Module 2]. Wrap up by [time]."

**Logistics** (If needed)
> "Housekeeping: Restrooms [location], phones silent, questions welcome anytime."

**Tone Setters**
> "No wrong questions. Safe space to learn and practice. Tools you can use immediately."

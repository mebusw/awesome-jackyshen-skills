| Like | Resonance | Emotional touch, instant认同 | Emotional consumption |
| Save | Tool-based | Future value, structured, extractable | Cognitive resource |

3. **Optimize for reach** - Address low view count despite good retention
4. **Final script** - Output clean version without timestamps
5. **Validate** - Re-evaluate final script against golden structure
6. **Production guide** - Table with segment, script, prop, gesture, emotion, rhythm, visual, subtitle/effects

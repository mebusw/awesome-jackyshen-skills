# Quiz Generator for Training

Create effective quiz questions that measure learning outcomes and validate knowledge application.

## Quiz Design Process

### 1. Align with Learning Outcomes

Start with learning outcomes, not topics. Map each outcome to question types:

| Learning Outcome | Question Type | Example |
|-----------------|---------------|---------|
| Apply [model] to [skill] | Scenario-based | Given [context], what would you do? |
| Distinguish concepts | Multiple choice | Which [concept] fits this situation? |
| Analyze using framework | Application | Which phase is happening in this dialogue? |
| Design action plan | Case analysis | Given this profile, what would you do? |

### 2. Ensure MECE Coverage

Cover all key topics without overlap:

```
[Topic] Coverage
├── Module 1: [Category] - X questions
├── Module 2: [Category] - X questions
└── Module 3: [Category] - X questions
```

**Verify:** proportional coverage per module, no gaps, minimal overlap, balanced difficulty.

### 3. Select Question Types

**Multiple Choice (Single Answer)**
- Best for: Testing concepts, models, frameworks
- 3-5 options, one clearly correct answer
- Avoid "all of the above" or "none of the above"

**Multiple Response (Select All)**
- Best for: Nuanced understanding, multiple correct approaches
- Specify how many options are correct
- All correct options must be equally valid

**Scenario/Case-Based**
- Best for: Application, judgment, higher-order thinking
- Provide realistic scenario, ask "what would you do?"
- Make relevant to learners' context

**True/False**
- Best for: Quick checks, clarifying misconceptions
- Statements clearly true or false
- Test important concepts, not trivia

**Fill-in-the-Blank**
- Best for: Key terms, models, frameworks
- Blanks have unique correct answers
- Provide sufficient context

**Open-Ended/Essay**
- Best for: Deep understanding, synthesis, personal application
- Provide clear evaluation criteria
- Use for higher-level learning (Bloom's evaluate/create)

### 4. Balance Bloom's Taxonomy

| Level | Percentage | Focus |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Remember/Understand | 30-40% | Basic knowledge, concepts |
| Apply | 30-40% | Using knowledge in scenarios |
| Analyze/Evaluate | 20-30% | Breaking down, judging |
| Create | 10-20% | Producing something new |

### 5. Set Difficulty Levels

- **Easy (20-30%)**: Basic recall, straightforward application
- **Medium (50-60%)**: Application, some analysis
- **Hard (10-20%)**: Complex scenarios, synthesis

### 6. Create Answer Keys

For each question include:
- Correct answer(s)
- Point value
- Explanation/rationale
- Common mistakes and why they're wrong

## Typical Quiz Structure

```
Total: 20 questions, 100 points, 30-45 minutes

Part 1: Knowledge Check (30 points)
- 10 multiple choice × 3 points

Part 2: Application (40 points)
- 4 scenario questions × 10 points

Part 3: Analysis (20 points)
- 2 true/false with explanation × 10 points

Part 4: Application (10 points)
- 1 open-ended question

Passing: 70/100 points
```

## Facilitator Script

### Objective (What happened?)

**Facilitator:**
"Let's start by reflecting on what actually happened in this exercise.

**Take a minute to silently think:**
- What did you do in this role-play?
- What actions did you take?
- What specifically did you say or hear?

**Turn to your partner and share 2-3 things you observed.**

[Allow 2-3 minutes for pairs]

**Now let's hear from the group: What did you observe happening in these role-plays?"

[Collect 3-4 responses]

### Reflective (How do you feel?)

**Facilitator:**
"Now let's check in with how it felt.

**Think about:**
- How did you feel going into the role-play?
- What was your initial reaction when it was your turn to give feedback?
- When did you feel most comfortable? When did you feel tense?
- What surprised you about your experience?

**Share with your partner: How did it feel?**"

[Allow 2-3 minutes]

"Let's hear some reflections. What emotions came up?"

[Collect responses, validate feelings]

"It's completely normal to feel [nervous/uncertain/relieved]. Many people feel that way when first trying this approach."

### Interpretive (What does it mean?)

**Facilitator:**
"Now let's make meaning of this experience.

**Consider:**
- What made this feedback approach effective or challenging?
- What patterns do you notice in what worked well?
- What differences do you see between this approach and how you typically give feedback?
- Why do you think the SBI structure (Situation-Behavior-Impact) matters?

**In your groups, discuss: What insights are emerging from this exercise?**"

[Allow 5 minutes for small group discussion]

"Let's come back together. What did your groups discover?"

[Collect insights]

**Key insights to extract (if not mentioned):**
- Specificity makes feedback less personal
- Starting with situation sets context
- Focusing on behavior not person reduces defensiveness
- Explaining impact creates shared understanding

"So what? Why does this matter for your work?"

[Collect responses on why this approach is valuable]

### Decisional (What will you do?)

**Facilitator:**
"Now let's turn this into action.

**Think about:**
- What will you do differently based on this experience?
- When is your first opportunity to try this approach?
- What specific situation will you apply this to?
- What support do you need to be successful?

**Write down:**
1. One specific conversation coming up where you'll use this
2. One thing you'll do differently in that conversation
3. What might get in the way (anticipate challenges)"

[Allow 3 minutes for writing]

**Pair share: Share your commitment with your partner.**

[Allow 2 minutes]

"Who's willing to share their commitment with the group?"

[Collect 2-3 volunteers]

**Closing:**
"As you leave today, remember: you have a practical tool. You've tried it, you know how it feels, you've reflected on why it works. Now go apply it. Your first opportunity is [reiterate volunteers' examples if applicable]."

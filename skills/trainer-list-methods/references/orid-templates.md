# ORID Facilitation Templates

## Overview

ORID (Objective, Reflective, Interpretive, Decisional) is a facilitated conversation method that guides groups through a structured reflection process. It ensures comprehensive understanding, emotional processing, meaning-making, and action planning.

## The ORID Framework

## Facilitation Tips

### Pacing and Flow

**Don't Rush:**
- Each stage serves a purpose
- Slow down = deeper learning
- Silence is productive

**Watch for Skips:**
- Groups jump to I (solutions) without O (facts)
- Groups avoid R (emotions) → lower engagement
- Groups stop at I (insights) without D (action)

**Transitions:**
- "Let's move from what happened to how it felt..."
- "Now that we've processed, what does it mean?"
- "So what? Now what?"

### Question Design

**Open-Ended:**
- ✅ "What did you observe?"
- ❌ "Did you see the presentation?"

**Specific but Not Leading:**
- ✅ "What stood out to you?"
- ❌ "Didn't you love the part about...?"

**Sequential:**
- Build from O → R → I → D
- Don't jump ahead

### Common Challenges

**Challenge: Silence at O Stage**
- Response: "Take a minute to silently recall what happened"
- Response: "Turn to your neighbor and share 3 things you observed"

**Challenge: Emotional flooding at R Stage**
- Response: "I hear there's strong feelings. Let's acknowledge them and then move to..."
- Response: "Take a breath. What else do you notice about how you feel?"

**Challenge: Jumping to solutions (skipping to D)**
- Response: "Hold on solutions. Let's first make sure we understand what happened."
- Response: "Before we decide, let's explore what this means."

**Challenge: Surface-level reflections at I Stage**
- Response: "Go deeper. What might be underneath this?"
- Response: "What else? What other interpretations exist?"

## ORID for Self-Reflection

```
O: What did I experience today?
R: How do I feel about it?
I: What did I learn? What does it mean for me?
D: What will I do tomorrow?
```

## Integration with Training Design

**In Workshop Outlines:**
- Include ORID debrief after each major activity
- Budget 10-15 minutes for full ORID
- Short version: 5 minutes (O+R+I+D each 1 question)

**In Content Creation:**
- Use ORID structure for articles (see → feel → think → do)
- Use ORID for video scripts
- ORID provides narrative flow that engages

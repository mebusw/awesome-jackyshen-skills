# WeChat Article Writer

Write engaging WeChat Official Account articles that capture attention, provide value, and drive engagement. Output in Markdown—use plain characters for tables (no MD tables) since WeChat editor cannot parse them.

## Key Principles

- **Pyramid Principle**: Main conclusion first, then supporting arguments
- **Engaging hooks**: First 60 seconds must grab attention
- **Emotional closing**: End with call-to-action and engagement prompt
- **Human tone**: Avoid AI-generated patterns and phrasing
- **Reader-focused**: Address "you" directly, solve real problems

## Article Parameters

Define before writing:
| Element | Options |
|---------|---------|
| **Purpose** | Inform, Inspire, Persuade, Entertain |
| **Tone** | Professional, Casual, Inspirational, Humorous |
| **Length** | Short: 800-1,200 words, Standard: 1,200-2,000 words |
| **Action** | Read, Share, Comment, Follow |

## Title Formulas

- **Numbered List**: "7 Time Management Tips to Add 2 Hours to Your Day"
- **How-to**: "How to Run Efficient Meetings? 3 Steps to Cut Time in Half"
- **Contrast**: "The Hard Work You're Doing Is Destroying Your Career"
- **Question**: "Why You Learn Everything Yet Still Struggle"
- **Story**: "From 5K to 50K Monthly: His 3-Year Secret Weapon"
- **Curiosity**: "3 Negotiation Tricks Communication Experts Never Tell You"

## Article Structure

└── Preview: Roadmap ahead

Body (70-75%)

**Content principles:**
